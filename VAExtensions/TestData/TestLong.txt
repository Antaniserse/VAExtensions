This is a longer text file example.
It can be used to test the features of the Viewer interface, via the "show_file" context command.
It's also useful for testing the Regular Expression feature, to limit the desired output to a specific part of the text
For example (see the test profile) i want to read only this text here: "This comes from a Regular Expression match"

This last paragraph is not really needed, but I need to keep the text long, that's why I'm still writing this!
